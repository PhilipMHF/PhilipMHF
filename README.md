- 👋 Hi, I’m @PhilipMHF
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and working my way towards becoming a developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and CSS through freeCodeCamp and some YTers such as Kevin Powell.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much any project that can teach me how to become a better and more efficient developer.
- 📫 My goal is to become a back-end developer and I'm willing to put in all the time and effort I physically and possibly can to make it come true.
